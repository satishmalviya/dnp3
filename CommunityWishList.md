## What can the community do to help? ##

We are generated a list of features that we will triage and vote on as a community for future releases. So far Green Energy folks have come up with the following wish list:

  * DNP secure authentication
  * TLS security implementation via [Boost.Asio's support for OpenSSL](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/doc/html/boost_asio/overview/ssl.html)
  * Improved code documentation and testing
  * Additional security testing
  * File transfer and device profile support
  * Improved test set and config file support
  * Platform independent XML binding support
  * Multi-core support using boost::asio::io\_service::strand
  * Acceptance testing platform written using this implementation
