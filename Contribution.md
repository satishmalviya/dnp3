## Contributor License Agreement (CLA) ##

Contributors must execute a CLA. This protects copyright interest and prevents incorporation of any patented technology. This process is similar to what the Apache Software Foundation requires of contributors. The CLA can be downloaded [here](http://www.totalgrid.org/storage/GECContributionLicenseAgreement.doc).

Please fax the CLA to the number indicated in the document.

## Workflow ##

The project uses Github for version control. Every contributor works on their own fork of the project:

  * Fork the project, creating a personal copy for yourself.
  * Make your changes and commit them back to your fork
  * Submit a 'pull request' to greenenergycorp or send an email to the google group
  * Someone will review your changes, possibly negotiate modifications, and then merge your changes into the mainline.
