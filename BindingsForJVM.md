# Artifacts #

The Java bindings consist of 2 binary artifacts both of which must be from the same release version of the project.

  1. A platform independent JAR with the Java bindings
  1. A shared library (dll or so) which the JAR loads automatically via the static classloader

The JAR can be obtained from our maven repository:

```
<distributionManagement>
    <repository>
        <id>https://repo.totalgrid.org</id>
        <name>https://repo.totalgrid.org-releases</name>
        <url>https://repo.totalgrid.org/artifactory/totalgrid-release</url>
    </repository>
</distributionManagement>
....
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.totalgrid.reef.protocol.dnp3</groupId>
    <artifactId>dnp3java</artifactId>
    <version>0.9.4</version>
</dependency>
```

The shared library is platform/architecture/kernel dependent. We have pre-compiled versions available for Windows and Ubuntu Lucid available from the downloads tab. If you're on another platform, you'll have to build the library from source.

The library must be placed in a folder that is on the Java library path. A safe bet is C:/windows/system32 for windows or /usr/lib for Linux.

If you are unsure what this value is set to for your JVM, examine the java.library.path Java environment variable.


# Examples #

The are currently no formal example projects in Java, however, the Java bindings are automatically generated by [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/). What this means is that the API is **identical** to the C++ API. All of the types are mirrored and wrapped.

The Reef project is using the Java binding in production, so be assured that the Java binding is stable. The examples that we currently have are written in Scala. There is an [integration test](https://github.com/gec/reef/blob/master/protocol-dnp3/src/test/scala/org/totalgrid/reef/protocol/dnp3/DNP3BindingTest.scala) available that starts many slaves and masters and tests that they properly communicate. This corresponds to a functionally identical test [written in C++](https://github.com/gec/dnp3/blob/master/DNP3Test/TestAsyncIntegration.cpp).
